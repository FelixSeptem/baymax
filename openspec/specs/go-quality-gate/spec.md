# go-quality-gate Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change upgrade-openai-native-stream-mapping. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Repository SHALL provide golangci-lint baseline configuration
The repository MUST include a version-controlled `golangci-lint` configuration file that defines enabled linters, runtime limits, and issue handling defaults for this codebase.

#### Scenario: Developer runs linter locally
- **WHEN** a developer executes `golangci-lint run`
- **THEN** lint behavior follows the shared repository configuration without requiring ad hoc local flags

### Requirement: Quality gate SHALL include golangci-lint in standard verification flow
The standard validation flow MUST include `golangci-lint`, `go test ./...`, `go test -race ./...`, and `govulncheck` so style, correctness, concurrency regressions, and dependency vulnerability risks are detected before merge.

`govulncheck` MUST run in strict mode by default, and vulnerability findings MUST fail validation unless explicitly downgraded by controlled configuration.

#### Scenario: Validation in CI or local pre-merge checks
- **WHEN** a change is validated before merge
- **THEN** linter execution, unit tests, race tests, and `govulncheck` are all required checks and failures block completion

#### Scenario: govulncheck finds vulnerabilities in strict mode
- **WHEN** validation runs with default strict scan mode and vulnerabilities are reported
- **THEN** quality gate exits non-zero and blocks merge

### Requirement: Lint profile SHALL align with Go style and safety priorities
The configured quality profile MUST enforce formatting/import conventions, detect common correctness risks, and include concurrency safety auditing practices.

#### Scenario: Code violates configured style or safety rules
- **WHEN** code introduces issues covered by enabled linters or race detection
- **THEN** validation output reports actionable diagnostics tied to file and line locations

### Requirement: Lint configuration changes SHALL be documented
Any newly introduced lint policy and recommended invocation commands MUST be documented under `docs/` for contributor onboarding.

#### Scenario: New contributor sets up development environment
- **WHEN** the contributor reads project documentation
- **THEN** they can run the documented lint and test commands with expected outcomes

### Requirement: Performance regression gate SHALL use relative percentage thresholds
Performance validation MUST evaluate benchmark outcomes using relative percentage change against a documented baseline.

#### Scenario: Benchmark comparison is executed
- **WHEN** benchmark results are compared for a candidate change
- **THEN** acceptance is decided by relative percentage thresholds for throughput and latency metrics

### Requirement: Concurrency safety SHALL be treated as a baseline quality requirement
Concurrency safety checks MUST be mandatory and cannot be bypassed in standard merge flow, including race detection and targeted concurrent diagnostics tests.

#### Scenario: Concurrency safety check fails
- **WHEN** race detection or required concurrent diagnostics tests fail
- **THEN** the change is rejected from merge until safety checks pass

### Requirement: Quality gate SHALL include diagnostics concurrency test coverage
The repository MUST maintain explicit tests for concurrent diagnostics writes, duplicate event replay, and idempotent persistence behavior.

#### Scenario: Diagnostics concurrency suite is executed
- **WHEN** diagnostics-focused concurrent tests run
- **THEN** write deduplication and data integrity guarantees are verified under parallel workloads

### Requirement: Quality-gate scripts SHALL provide cross-platform security scan parity
Repository-provided quality-gate scripts for Linux and PowerShell MUST both execute the same vulnerability scan semantics as CI.

#### Scenario: Linux and PowerShell scripts are executed
- **WHEN** contributors run quality-gate scripts on different platforms
- **THEN** both flows execute equivalent test/lint/race/vuln checks and produce consistent pass/fail semantics
