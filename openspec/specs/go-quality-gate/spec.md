# go-quality-gate Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change upgrade-openai-native-stream-mapping. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Repository SHALL provide golangci-lint baseline configuration
The repository MUST include a version-controlled `golangci-lint` configuration file that defines enabled linters, runtime limits, and issue handling defaults for this codebase.

#### Scenario: Developer runs linter locally
- **WHEN** a developer executes `golangci-lint run`
- **THEN** lint behavior follows the shared repository configuration without requiring ad hoc local flags

### Requirement: Quality gate SHALL include golangci-lint in standard verification flow
The standard validation flow MUST include `golangci-lint`, `go test ./...`, `go test -race ./...`, `govulncheck`, and mainline contract test suites so style, correctness, concurrency regressions, dependency vulnerability risks, and cross-module semantic regressions are detected before merge.

`govulncheck` MUST run in strict mode by default, and vulnerability findings MUST fail validation unless explicitly downgraded by controlled configuration.

#### Scenario: Validation in CI or local pre-merge checks
- **WHEN** a change is validated before merge
- **THEN** linter execution, unit tests, race tests, vulnerability scan, and required mainline contract tests are all required checks and failures block completion

#### Scenario: govulncheck finds vulnerabilities in strict mode
- **WHEN** validation runs with default strict scan mode and vulnerabilities are reported
- **THEN** quality gate exits non-zero and blocks merge

### Requirement: Lint profile SHALL align with Go style and safety priorities
The configured quality profile MUST enforce formatting/import conventions, detect common correctness risks, and include concurrency safety auditing practices.

#### Scenario: Code violates configured style or safety rules
- **WHEN** code introduces issues covered by enabled linters or race detection
- **THEN** validation output reports actionable diagnostics tied to file and line locations

### Requirement: Lint configuration changes SHALL be documented
Any newly introduced lint policy and recommended invocation commands MUST be documented under `docs/` for contributor onboarding.

#### Scenario: New contributor sets up development environment
- **WHEN** the contributor reads project documentation
- **THEN** they can run the documented lint and test commands with expected outcomes

### Requirement: Performance regression gate SHALL use relative percentage thresholds
Performance validation MUST evaluate benchmark outcomes using relative percentage change against a documented baseline.

#### Scenario: Benchmark comparison is executed
- **WHEN** benchmark results are compared for a candidate change
- **THEN** acceptance is decided by relative percentage thresholds for throughput and latency metrics

### Requirement: Concurrency safety SHALL be treated as a baseline quality requirement
Concurrency safety checks MUST be mandatory and cannot be bypassed in standard merge flow, including race detection and targeted concurrent diagnostics tests.

#### Scenario: Concurrency safety check fails
- **WHEN** race detection or required concurrent diagnostics tests fail
- **THEN** the change is rejected from merge until safety checks pass

### Requirement: Quality gate SHALL include diagnostics concurrency test coverage
The repository MUST maintain explicit tests for concurrent diagnostics writes, duplicate event replay, and idempotent persistence behavior.

#### Scenario: Diagnostics concurrency suite is executed
- **WHEN** diagnostics-focused concurrent tests run
- **THEN** write deduplication and data integrity guarantees are verified under parallel workloads

### Requirement: Quality-gate scripts SHALL provide cross-platform security scan parity
Repository-provided quality-gate scripts for Linux and PowerShell MUST both execute the same vulnerability scan semantics as CI.

#### Scenario: Linux and PowerShell scripts are executed
- **WHEN** contributors run quality-gate scripts on different platforms
- **THEN** both flows execute equivalent test/lint/race/vuln checks and produce consistent pass/fail semantics

### Requirement: Quality gate SHALL enforce repository hygiene checks
The standard validation flow MUST include repository hygiene checks that reject temporary backup artifacts and stale generated-by-accident files that are outside committed source-of-truth conventions.

#### Scenario: Temporary backup file is tracked
- **WHEN** repository hygiene checks detect files matching banned temporary patterns
- **THEN** validation fails and requires cleanup before merge

### Requirement: Mainline contract coverage SHALL be explicitly traceable
The repository MUST maintain a traceable mapping between required mainline flows and their corresponding contract test cases.

#### Scenario: Contributor reviews test coverage for a critical chain
- **WHEN** contributor inspects quality-gate documentation or test index
- **THEN** contributor can identify which contract test covers each required mainline flow

### Requirement: Quality gate SHALL include CA4 benchmark regression checks
The standard validation flow MUST include CA4-related benchmark checks evaluated by relative percentage thresholds, including P95 latency constraints.

#### Scenario: CA4 benchmark regression exceeds threshold
- **WHEN** candidate benchmark result exceeds configured relative degradation or P95 threshold
- **THEN** validation fails and change cannot be completed until regression is mitigated or explicitly re-baselined

### Requirement: CA4 benchmark policy SHALL align with documented performance rules
CA4 benchmark acceptance criteria MUST align with repository performance policy and remain documented for local and CI execution parity.

#### Scenario: Contributor runs CA4 performance validation
- **WHEN** contributor follows documented commands
- **THEN** contributor can reproduce the same pass/fail semantics locally and in CI

### Requirement: CI workflow SHALL pin critical lint tooling version
The default CI workflow MUST use a pinned `golangci-lint` version rather than floating `latest` to ensure reproducible validation behavior across time.

#### Scenario: CI executes lint job on different dates
- **WHEN** the same commit is validated at different times
- **THEN** lint pass/fail semantics remain stable unless repository-owned version pin is intentionally changed

### Requirement: CI workflow SHALL avoid duplicated quality-gate stages
The default CI workflow MUST avoid duplicate execution of repository hygiene checks when the quality-gate script already includes the same check.

#### Scenario: Workflow runs standard validation
- **WHEN** CI executes the default quality gate
- **THEN** repository hygiene is executed exactly once in the canonical validation path

### Requirement: CI workflow SHALL declare least-privilege permissions and timeout
The default CI workflow MUST explicitly declare minimum required GitHub Actions permissions and define job timeout to prevent unbounded execution.

#### Scenario: Workflow job starts on pull request
- **WHEN** CI job initializes
- **THEN** the job runs under explicit least-privilege permissions and bounded timeout settings

### Requirement: Quality gate SHALL enforce contribution template completeness checks
The standard validation flow MUST execute contribution-template completeness checks for pull requests, and missing required sections or unchecked mandatory checklist items MUST fail validation.

This check MUST be configured as a required CI status check in the default merge flow.

#### Scenario: Pull request misses required template section
- **WHEN** CI validates a pull request body missing one or more required sections
- **THEN** the contribution-template check exits non-zero and blocks merge

#### Scenario: Pull request omits mandatory checklist confirmation
- **WHEN** CI validates a pull request with required checklist items left unchecked or removed
- **THEN** the contribution-template check exits non-zero and blocks merge

#### Scenario: Pull request satisfies template requirements
- **WHEN** CI validates a pull request containing all required sections and mandatory checklist confirmations
- **THEN** the contribution-template check passes and does not block merge

### Requirement: Quality gate SHALL include diagnostics replay contract check
The standard CI validation flow MUST include a diagnostics replay contract check that validates replay behavior against version-controlled fixtures.

Failures in replay contract validation MUST block merge.

#### Scenario: Replay contract check fails in pull request
- **WHEN** CI runs replay gate and output or reason-code expectations diverge from fixtures
- **THEN** replay gate exits non-zero and pull request cannot pass required validation

#### Scenario: Replay contract check passes in pull request
- **WHEN** CI runs replay gate and fixtures match expected output and reason codes
- **THEN** replay gate reports success and does not block merge

### Requirement: Replay gate SHALL be exposed as independent required-check candidate
The CI workflow MUST expose replay validation in an independent job suitable for branch-protection required status checks.

#### Scenario: Maintainer configures branch protection
- **WHEN** maintainer reviews available status checks
- **THEN** replay gate appears as a distinct check that can be configured as required

### Requirement: Quality gate SHALL include S2 security policy contract checks
The standard CI validation flow MUST include S2 security policy contract checks that validate:
- `namespace+tool` permission deny/allow semantics,
- process-scoped rate-limit deny semantics,
- model input/output filtering deny semantics,
- hot-reload invalid-update rollback semantics.

Failures in S2 security policy contract checks MUST block merge.

#### Scenario: S2 security contract check fails in pull request
- **WHEN** CI runs S2 security contract checks and expected permission/rate-limit/filter/reload behavior diverges from fixtures
- **THEN** security policy gate exits non-zero and pull request cannot pass required validation

#### Scenario: S2 security contract check passes in pull request
- **WHEN** CI runs S2 security contract checks and all expected behaviors match fixtures
- **THEN** security policy gate reports success and does not block merge

### Requirement: Security policy gate SHALL be exposed as independent required-check candidate
The CI workflow MUST expose S2 security policy validation in an independent job suitable for branch-protection required status checks.

#### Scenario: Maintainer configures branch protection for S2
- **WHEN** maintainer reviews available CI status checks
- **THEN** security policy gate appears as a distinct check that can be configured as required

### Requirement: Quality gate SHALL include S3 security-event contract checks
The standard CI validation flow MUST include S3 security-event contract checks that validate deny-only alert triggering, callback dispatch semantics, severity normalization, and Run/Stream semantic equivalence.

Failures in S3 security-event contract checks MUST block merge.

#### Scenario: S3 security-event contract check fails
- **WHEN** CI runs S3 security-event contracts and observed taxonomy/alert semantics diverge from fixtures
- **THEN** security-event gate exits non-zero and pull request cannot pass required validation

#### Scenario: S3 security-event contract check passes
- **WHEN** CI runs S3 security-event contracts and all expected behaviors match fixtures
- **THEN** security-event gate reports success and does not block merge

### Requirement: Security-event gate SHALL be exposed as independent required-check candidate
The CI workflow MUST expose S3 security-event validation in an independent job suitable for branch-protection required status checks.

#### Scenario: Maintainer configures branch protection for S3
- **WHEN** maintainer reviews available CI checks
- **THEN** security-event gate appears as a distinct check that can be configured as required

### Requirement: Quality gate SHALL include S4 security delivery contract checks
CI validation flow MUST include S4 security delivery contract checks that verify async delivery behavior, `drop_old` queue policy, retry budget enforcement, Hystrix-style circuit state transitions, and Run/Stream semantic equivalence.
Failures in S4 delivery contract checks MUST block merge.

#### Scenario: S4 delivery contract check fails
- **WHEN** CI runs S4 delivery contracts and observed delivery semantics diverge from contract fixtures
- **THEN** security delivery gate exits non-zero and pull request cannot pass required validation

#### Scenario: S4 delivery contract check passes
- **WHEN** CI runs S4 delivery contracts and all expected semantics are satisfied
- **THEN** security delivery gate reports success and does not block merge

### Requirement: Security delivery gate SHALL be exposed as independent required-check candidate
CI workflow MUST expose S4 delivery validation as an independent job named `security-delivery-gate` that can be configured as branch-protection required check.

#### Scenario: Maintainer configures branch protection for S4
- **WHEN** maintainer reviews available CI checks
- **THEN** `security-delivery-gate` appears as a distinct status check
